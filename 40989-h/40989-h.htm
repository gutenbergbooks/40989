<p>The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six volumes.
Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further divided into two
e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume&nbsp;I, the General Introduction,
will be released after all other volumes, matching the original
publication order.</p>

<p>All brackets are in the original, as are parenthetical question marks and (<i>sic</i>) notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are shown as printed. Note that the printed book used <b>z</b> to represent original yogh <b>ȝ</b>. This has not been changed for the e-text. The copy number (first page of each volume) is hand-written.</p>

<p>The year of each letter was printed in a sidenote at the top of the page; this has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each letter. Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page number to make them usable with the full Index. They are grouped at the end of each Letter or Abstract.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title ="like this">Text lightly shaded in
violet</ins> indicates the site of a typographical error. Hover the
cursor over the shaded text, and the explanation should appear.
Typographical errors are listed again at the end of the Letter, after any footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing italics, or mechanical, such as <span class = "locked">u-for-n</span> misprints. Italic “d” misprinted as “a” was a recurring problem. The word “invisible” means that there is an appropriately sized blank space, but the letter or punctuation mark itself is missing.</p>

<p><i>Some Specifics:</i> The spelling “Jhon” is not an error. Gresham and Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling of the name “Lipyate” or “Lipgate” in footnotes is unchanged.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Before</span> entering upon the correspondence
of the Paston family, in the reign of Henry&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, we have thought it well to give the reader a
brief note of such deeds and charters of an earlier date as appear
either to have been preserved in the family, or to have any bearing on
its history. The following is a list of those we have been able to meet
with either in the originals or in other quarters, such as Blomefield’s
<i>History of Norfolk</i>, where notices are given of several documents,
which appear now to have got into unknown hands. The documents seen by
Blomefield, and those from the Paston and Dawson-Turner collections, now
in the British Museum, were probably all at one time part of the Paston
family muniments. The three Harleian charters seem to have been derived
from a different source.</p>

<div class = "annotation">

<p>A Deed is cited by Blomefield (<i>Hist. Norf.</i> vi. 480), by which
Anselm, Abbot of St. Benet’s, Hulme, and the Convent there, gave to
Osbern, the priest (said by Blomefield to have been a son of Griffin de
Thwait, the founder of the Paston family), the land of St. Benet’s of
Paston (<i>terram Sancti Benedicti de Paston</i>), in fee, for half the
farm of one <i>caruca</i>, as his ancestors used to pay for the
same.</p>

<p>Also a Deed of William the Abbot (who lived in King Stephen’s reign),
granting to Richer de Pastun, son of Osbern, son of Griffin de Thwete,
all the land that the Convent held in Pastun, with their men, and other
pertinencies.</p>

<p>Also a Deed of Covenant between Richer de Paston and Reginald the
Abbot, and Convent of St. Benet’s, Holme, that when peace should be
settled in England, and pleas held in the Court of our Lord the King,
the said Richer would, at the request and at the expense of the Abbot,
give him every security in Court to release the lands in Pastun.</p>

<p>‘Ralph de Paston was son, as I take it’ (says Blomefield) ‘of this
Richer, and appears to have had two sons, Richard and Nicholas.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page2" id = "page2">2</a></span>

<p>‘Richard, son of Ralph de Paston, by his deed, <i>sans</i> date,
granted to Geoffrey, son of Roger de Tweyt, lands in this town (Oxnead),
paying 9d. per ann. for his homage and service, 40s. for a fine
(<i>in&nbsp;gersumam</i>), and paying to him and his heirs on the feasts
of St. Andrew, Candlemas, Pentecost, and St. Michael, on each feast, 2s.
<i>ob.</i> He sealed with one <i>lis</i>. Laurence de Reppes, William
and John, his brother, William de Bradfield, &amp;c., were
witnesses.’&mdash;Blomefield, vi. <span class =
"locked">480&ndash;1.</span></p>

<p>‘There was also another branch of this family, of which was Wystan,
or Wolstan, de Paston, which I take to be the lineal ancestor of Sir
William Paston, the Judge, and the Earls of Yarmouth. This Wolstan lived
in the reign of Henry&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">II.</span> and
Richard&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I.</span>, and married, as is
probable, a&nbsp;daughter of the Glanvilles, as appeared from an
impalement of Paston and Glanville in the windows of Paston Hall in
Paston. His son and heir styled himself Robert de Wyston and Robert de
Paston; who, dying in or about 1242, was buried at Bromholm, and left
Edmund de Paston. To this Edmund, son of Robert, son of Wolstan de
Paston, Sir Richard de Paston gave the land in Paston which Robert, his
father, held of him and Nicholas, his brother, by deed <i>sans</i>
date.’&mdash;Blomefield, vi. 481.</p>

<p>Undated Deed of Nicholaus filius Radulfi Diaconi de Paston, granting
to Robert, son of Wistan de Paston, two parcels of land&mdash;one of
them abutting on the lands of Eudo de Paston. Witnesses&mdash;Richard de
Trunch; Will. Esprygy; Ralph de Reppes; Roger de Reppes; Richard, s. of
Ralph de Baketon; John de Reppes; Roger, s. of Warin de Paston; Hugh, s.
of Will. de Paston, &amp;c.&mdash;Add. Charter 17,217, B.M. (Paston
<span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>).</p>

<p>Undated Deed of Richard, son of Ralph de Pastune, granting to Edmund,
son of Robert Wistan de Pastune, lands in Pastune,
&amp;c.&mdash;(<i>Seal attached, in fine condition.</i>)&mdash;Add.
Charter 17,218, B.M. (Paston <span class =
"smallroman">MSS.</span>).</p>

<p>Blomefield also mentions (vi. 481) that Nicholas, son of Ralph de
Paston, gave lands to Robert, son of Wystan de Paston, by deed <i>sans
date</i>. Witness, Roger de Repps.</p>

<p>Undated Deed Poll, by which Richard, the son of Ralph, Deacon of
Paston, grants to Edmund, the son of Robert Wiston of Paston, certain
lands at Paston.&mdash;Add. Charter 14,810, B.M. (D.&nbsp;Turner’s
Collection of Deeds relating to Norfolk).</p>

<p>Richard, son of Ralph de Paston, according to Blomefield
(xi.&nbsp;24), gave 12<i>d.</i> a year rent in Paston to the Priory of
Bromholm. This gift is also mentioned by Richard Taylor in his Index
Monasticus of the Diocese of Norwich, p. 15, where the purpose of the
endowment is said to be ‘to keep their books in repair.’</p>

<p>Deed, cited by Blomefield (vi. 481), by Richard, son of John, son of
Richard de Paston, granting to Richer Alunday and his heirs his native
Alan de Tilney, with all his family, &amp;c. (<i>cum tota sequela</i>),
and 7 acres of land in Paston and Knapton, with messuages, &amp;c., for
4 marks of silver <i>in gersumam</i>, and a rent of 22<i>d.</i> a
year.</p>

Paston, who is here spoken of as a Serjeant, attained that degree in
1421, and was made Judge of the Common Pleas in 1429. But a closer
approximation to the date of this letter may be made by comparing it
with that which follows, which is certainly much about the same

William Paston, as appears by 12 and <a href = "#letter14">14</a> following, disputed this
writer’s right to call himself Paston, and asserted that his real name
was Wortes. It is curious that neither in the list of the Bishops of
Cork, nor in that of the Priors of Bromholm, is the name either of
Paston or Wortes to be met with.</p>

lord’s life, except of 2 pipes for herself, and one for her
mother-in-law, of which she has paid 20s. Since my Lord’s death, Steyard
has never asked her for it. ‘For which time, as I was at Jernemouth
abiding in the Frere Carmes the time of the pestilence, his wife came
unto me,’ asking the writer to be good lady to him; and he asked no more
then than the above 3 pipes. He asked no more last harvest when he was
sick and like to die, when John of Berneye was present. Thinks,
therefore, his asking is untrue. My Lord would have made me or some of
his council privy to such a debt. Hopes Paston, whom my Lord made one of
his feoffees, will see ‘that ye and I be discharged anemps the King as
for the debt of Steyard.’&mdash;Dated Castre, the day after the

the death of said Eliz., however, he bought the manor for 420 marks, and
held it two years, when Wyoth re-entered because part of the
purchase-money was unpaid. W. Moleyns’s wife, however, induced him to
accept security from Thos. Fawkoner, merchant of London, whose daughter
the said William agreed that his son should marry, when he came of age;
and it was arranged that meanwhile Fawkoner and Wyoth should be jointly
enfeoffed of the manor, which was to be given in jointure, if the
marriage took effect. The marriage did not take effect, and Fawkoner
re-entered upon the manor according to the enfeoffment, but paid Wyoth
nothing, till Thos. Chawsers,<a class = "tag" name = "tag31_1" id =

to Chaucers and Wyoth, and released the manor on security for the
payment. Wyoth then said he should have little advantage by the bargain,
except in having easy days of payment; ‘et quod dictus Thomas Chaucers,

<p>Prefixed to this document in Fenn is the following title:&mdash; ‘A
Petition to the Commons of England against Sir William Paston, Knight,
a&nbsp;Judge of the Common Pleas, by William Dalling.’ This heading,
however, has been taken from a more modern endorsement. No
contemporaneous document, so far as I am aware, gives Judge Paston the
designation of knight, or speaks of him as Sir William. In this petition
itself he is called simply William Paston, one of the Justices; and
although his name occurs frequently on the Patent Rolls, in commissions
of the peace, of gaol delivery, and the like, down to the year of his
death, the word ‘miles’ is never appended to&nbsp;it.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The writer of
this letter was the father of Robert, first Lord Willoughby de Broke,
who afterwards laid claim to the barony of Latimer, as being descended
from Elizabeth, sister and sole heir of John Nevill, fifth Lord Latimer,
who died in 1430. He was, however, unsuccessful, as the title had been
revived in 1432 by a writ of summons to George Nevill, a&nbsp;son of
Ralph, first Earl of Westmoreland. This George died in 1469, and was
succeeded by his grandson, Richard Neville, then an infant of two years
old, who had summons to Parliament as Lord Latimer in 1492. The Lord
Latimer here spoken of seems to be George Nevill, and it is probable
that the letter was written between 1432 and 1440, as John, Lord
Beaumont, was created Viscount in the latter year, while he is not so
addressed here.</p>

[This paper is addressed to John Berney of Reedham, and appears, by an
endorsement, to have been transmitted along with a letter of William
Paston. The date is fixed by the contents within pretty narrow limits,
for it is after the death of John Boys, Esq., which was in August 1439
(Inquis. <i>post mortem</i>, 18 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, No.&nbsp;2), and before that of Sir Simon
Felbrigg in 1442 (Inquis. <i>p.&nbsp;m.</i>, 21 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, No.&nbsp;33). It is easy to see, in fact, that
the document had something to do with the marriage settlement of John
Paston and Margaret Mauteby, which was about 1440.]</p>

Touching a suit of Reynold Rowse against William Burgeys. This suit was
instituted originally for 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> of rent; but when Rouse
found he could not prevail by right, he maliciously sued the other for
trespass in having fished his water, and driven him away by force. He
afterwards got him arrested for treachery upon an obligation
(<i>i.e.</i>, a bond). Burgeys complained to Justice Paston, who
counselled him not to plead; ‘For zyf thu do, he seyd, thu xalte hafe

[This letter is mutilated, and in part defaced. It is addressed on the

Although the name seems to be written Brele, it was probably intended
for Friar Brackley of Norwich, of whom we have several letters of a
later period. The date must be between the year 1429, when William
Paston was made a judge, and 1444, when he died; and as the name of
Reginald Rows occurs in Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norfolk</i>, ix. 441)
‘about 1440,’ this letter will probably not be far out of its true place

Probably Thomas Wetherby, who was Mayor of Norwich in 1432&ndash;3, is
referred to. He took offence at the Aldermen and Commons of the city for
not naming the person he wished as his successor, and for some years
afterwards showed his hostility by instigating prosecutions against the
city, causing their attorneys to abandon their pleas, and so forth.</p>

ea de causa Reverendus Magister Walden<a class = "tag" name = "tag54_1"
id = "tag54_1" href = "#note54_1">54.1</a> interrogavit eum si vellet
esse frater, et dixit quod vellet et humiliter rogavit ex caritate. Et
veraciter scit quod fuit ætatis xiiij. annorum et amplius tempore
professionis suæ et moram traxit ibidem per iij. vel iiij. annos. Et
postea fuit apud Maldon per duos annos, et ab illo loco exiit. Deinde
captus et Norwico incarceratus per dimidium annum. Et postea in domo de
Blakney per iiijºr annos mansit, et ibidem fuit terminarius et hospes;
et cucurrit ab inde cum vestibus officii de domo hospicii furtive et
cepit librum (?) Alburugh avunculi sui et canciavit illum apud Aylesham

<p>Et addidit idem Johannes Hawteyn vel Alburugh frater et avunculus
dicti Johannis Hawteyn quod Johannes Hawteyn apostata fuit natus apud
Swafham Market circa iiij. annum post transitum patris sui a Scheryngton
usque Swafham. Et dicit quod Robertus frater ejus fuit pluris ætatis
quam Johannes fuit per iiijºr annos, et dictus Robertus fuit natus apud
Scherynton.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 26.] ‘From a memorandum,’ says Fenn, ‘on the back of
this letter, dated in April 1444, it is probable that it was written on
the 30th of January 1443.’ Did Fenn mean the 30th of January
1443&ndash;4? In the side-note immediately below the letter, he dates it
in his usual exact manner, ‘Wednesday, 30th of January 1443, 22 H. vi.’
But unfortunately there is an error here. January in the 22d year of
Henry&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>, means January 1444
according to the modern computation, or 1443 in the style formerly in
use, by which the year was reckoned from the 25th of March. But the 30th
of January was a Wednesday in 1443, only according to the modern
computation of the year,&mdash;that is to say, it was a Wednesday in the
year 1442&ndash;3, not in 1443&ndash;4. I&nbsp;imagine, however, that
the ‘30th of January’ should have been ‘29th of January,’ and that Fenn
really meant 1443&ndash;4, corresponding with the 22nd year of
Henry&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>; for the memorandum to
which he refers is a draft agreement, dated on Passion Sunday, 22 Hen.

[From Fenn, i. 10.] Fenn thinks this letter must have been written
before 1444, when Yelverton was made a judge. This is, doubtless, most
probable. There is, however, an Edmund Swathing, Esq., mentioned by
Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norfolk</i>, viii.&nbsp;42) as alive in 1446,
and if it be his executors who are referred to, the date would appear to
be later.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 16.] The writer of this letter was the widow of John
Mowbray, second Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1432. After the Duke’s
death, she married again no less than three times; and Fenn thinks this
letter, which is dated from Epworth in Lincolnshire, a&nbsp;seat of the
Duke of Norfolk’s, was probably written during her first widowhood. It
must be remarked, however, that in 1432 John Paston was only twelve
years old at the utmost, so that this letter could hardly have been
written till at least ten years after. It is, besides, hardly probable
that John Paston would have been addressed as the owner of a ‘place’ in
London, before his father’s death in 1444. The exact year, however, is
quite uncertain.</p>

exact year when this letter was written; but as the writer was created
Duke of Buckingham on the 14th September 1441, and his son, the Earl of

<p><i>Letter</i> [on paper, in English] from two counsel, <i>William
Wangeford</i> and <i>William Jenney</i>, to Sir John Fastolf, giving
their opinion on his claim against the prior of Hickling. Sir John
cannot recover the £20 forfeit, because the condition of the obligation
only extended to the heirs of Sir Hugh Clifford, and not to his assigns,
and Sir John is only an assign; but the rent of 25 marks is sure to him,
and he can recover it, if denied by the prior, by process of law; they
will consult with justices and serjeants whether he can recover it by
distraint.</p>

<p><i>Letter</i>, [in English, on paper] from <i>Henry Notyngham</i> to
Sir Henry Barton, Alderman of London. Has counselled with Paston, and
finds him more friendly and ready to help in Barton’s matter than ever
before; supposes that the cause is, that the prior that was obstinate is
dead, and another appointed, who Paston trusts will be more easy to
stir. Desires that Paston may be thanked. Sends a letter which he
desires ‘a&nbsp;child of zours’ may carry to Mistress Jenkin Leventhorpe
the younger; and ask at my lord’s inn of Doreham or of Ratclyff or some
other which he may think best, if he (<i>i.e.</i> my Lord of Durham)
shall be at this Parliament. Send to Thomelin Grys, spicer at Norwich,
some ‘loder,’ as soon as he can goodly buy it, which comes each week to

<p><i>Letter</i>, [in English, on paper] from <i>H[enry] Notyngham</i>
to Sir Henry Barton, alderman of London. Delivered Paston the copy of
the deeds; shewed his letter to the prior and convent, but gained
nothing; they said they would please Barton full fain, but all their
counsel are full against their binding themselves by any such
confirmation; they were bound to the former owner and his

thinks nothing can be done unless he gets Paston’s assent and grant to
help the matter.</p>

<p><i>Letter</i> [in English, on paper] <i>from</i> ‘<i>W. [Hart],
Bisshope of Norwich</i>,’ to Sir John Fastolf. Has put himself greatly
in his devoir to put an end to the controversy between Fastolf and the
house of Hykelyng, and has been so importunate that Lord Scales has
advised him not to meddle in the matter, because he is taken as a
suspect person; if he could do him more profit, he would not spare
labour or cost, on account of Fastolf’s towardness and gentleness to
condescend unto right and reasonable mean, the which he conceives not in
the other party. Had hoped his good and devout purpose towards the place
of St. Bennett’s would have grown to some good conclusion; was there the
Sunday before St. Laurence’s Day, and greatly rejoiced at such work and
cost as he has done there. Heartily desires him to come here to the air
of his natural birth, where he will find my Lord of Norfolk and such
attendance as the Bishop and other gentles of the country may do, ready
unto him at all times; his coming would be to his health and heart’s
ease, and the cause of much peace in the country.</p>

<p>On Friday last, the Parson of Oxened ‘being at messe in one Parossh
Chirche, evyn at levacion of the sakeryng, Jamys Gloys had been in the
town, and come homeward by Wymondam’s gate,’ when he was attacked by
Wymondham who had two of his men with him, and driven into ‘my mother’s
place’ for refuge. With the noise of this, my mother and I came out of
the church from the sakeryng, and Wymondham ‘called my mother and me
strong whores, and said, ye Pastons and all her kin were
&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; .&nbsp;
.&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; yngham said he lied, knave and churl
as he was.’ After noon my mother and I reported this to the Prior of
Norwich, who sent for Wymondham; and Pagrave came with us. While
Wymondham was with the Prior, and we at home, Gloys was assaulted again
in the street, ‘as he stood in the Lady Hastyngs’ chamber,’ by Thomas
Hawys, one of Wymondham’s men. This last assault the Parson of Oxened
saw. Sends Gloys to her husband for fear of further trouble. The Lady
Morle ‘would have the benefice of her obligacion,’ as her counsel tells
her it is forfeit, and she would not have the relief till she have your
homage. The Lord Moleyns’ man is collecting the rent at Gresham
‘a&nbsp;great pace,’ as James Gresham will report to you.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 190.] It appears, by John Paston’s petition presented to
Parliament two years later, that after he had been dispossessed of
Gresham by Lord Molyns in February 1448, communications passed between
his counsel and that of Lord Molyns on the subject until Michaelmas
following. This letter must refer to the first overtures.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 408.] Fenn thinks this was written about 1460, but I do
not see on what evidence. From the reference to Gresham, I&nbsp;should
rather suppose it belongs to 1449. By the subscription, it would appear
that the writer was very near the time of lying in; but we cannot tell
the exact date of the birth of any of her children. Lord Molyns
dispossessed John Paston of the lordship of Gresham on the 17th of
February 1448. After repeated remonstrances on the subject to no
purpose, Paston went and took up his quarters there again on the 6th
October 1449, and succeeded in keeping possession till the 28th January
1450, when the place was attacked, in his absence, by Lord Molyns’ men,
who undermined the walls, and drove out Paston’s wife. The ‘errands
about Gresham’ probably refer to the time of Lord Molyns’ first
occupation.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 80.] There is no distinct clue to the date of this
letter; but Fenn throws out a conjecture which, in default of any better
guide, may be accepted as not improbable, that ‘the Bishop of the other
side of the sea’ was Walter Lyhert, Bishop of Norwich, who in the
beginning of 1449 must have been in Savoy, having been sent thither by
the King to persuade the anti-pope Felix&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">V.</span> to renounce his claim to Nicholas&nbsp;<span
class = "smallroman">V.</span> for the peace of the Church. This Felix
actually did in the beginning of this year, and Wharton considers Bishop
Lyhert to have been the cause of his doing so (Angl. Sac. i. 418). Fenn,
however, dates this letter 1450, on the supposition that the Bishop
would have been still abroad in the beginning of that year, which is a
mistake, as his name appears in the Rolls of Parliament as a trier of
petitions as early as February.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 314.] ‘The direction of this curious letter,’ says
Fenn, ‘is obliterated, but it is plainly from Margaret Paston to her
husband; and the paper is likewise so completely filled with writing,
that she has not even either subscribed or dated it, but by the
mentioning of Sir John Fastolf it must have been written before 1459.’
It appears to us most probably to belong to the year 1449, when Paston
was making preparations to re-enter Gresham, which he actually did in
October of that year.</p>

So the date is given in the book from which this letter is copied, but
the year is certainly wrong, as the writer did not go to reside at
Caister till 1454. The date indeed would have been suspicious apart from
this, as the mode of dating is quite unusual in these letters. Probably
in the original <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> (which the Editor

[From Fenn, iii. 202.] This letter is dated by Fenn 1454, with some
others relating to matches proposed for Elizabeth Paston; but the date
of this cannot be later than 1451, as Sir Harry Inglos died that year.
Moreover, it cannot be either 1451 or 1450, as ‘the Saturday next after
Midsummer’ when this letter is dated, preceded ‘the Wednesday next after
Midsummer day’ in both these years. Thus 1449 is the latest possible
date.</p>

The marriage of wards in those days used to be sold to men of property,
who would compel them to marry their own sons or daughters, or whatever
other persons suited them. The only restriction to this right was, that
the ward might, on coming of age, have an action against his guardian in
case of <i>disparagement</i>, that is to say, if he was married beneath
his station.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 84.] Richard Nevill, Earl of Warwick, afterwards famous
as the ‘King-maker,’ succeeded to the title in 1449, and this letter is
not unlikely to have been written in that very year. Certainly it is not
many years later. In 1449 and 1450 Warwick was probably in London to
attend the Parliament.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 282.] This letter is dated by Fenn between 1455 and
1460, but cannot be later than the former of these years, as Lord
Cromwell died in the beginning of 1456. It seems, further, beyond a
doubt that the Lord Willoughby, mentioned along with him, was Robert,
Lord Willoughby of Eresby, who was connected by marriage both with Lord
Cromwell and with Lord Welles; and if so the date cannot be later than
1451, as this Lord Willoughby died in July 1452. Indeed, I&nbsp;have
very little doubt it is before 1450, as both Tailboys and Beaumont were
of the Duke of Suffolk’s party, and it is not likely that the former
would have ventured to complain of his powerful neighbours, Lords
Willoughby, Cromwell, and Welles after the Duke’s fall, especially as we
know that in the beginning of 1450 he was in prison for an attempt to
murder Lord Cromwell.</p>

‘Chevers mater in Blyclyng,’ of an unpaid annuity at Hiklyng, of decays

Wynterton which Broun holds alone. It is too much for one to occupy

by a paper, which will be found further on (<a href = "#letter119">No.&nbsp;119</a>), that Daniel
entered the manor of Braydeston or Brayston during the Parliament which
was held at Leicester in the spring of 1450. This letter must have been

of which are, like the last, written by Lord Scales to John Paston, are
placed here merely for convenience, the years in which they were written
being quite uncertain, though probably not very far apart. The one
letter among them of which Lord Scales is not the writer, is inserted in

Stywardesson came to her on Easter even to church, and made a very

he was beaten, only that he was sore afraid; but at last acknowledged he
had untruly charged her men with coming into his place with force and
arms, and that he was beaten, for which his master took an action
against her. Called her tenants to bear witness to his recantation. Said
she would give him no answer now but by advice of her friends, and his
master must leave his maintenance. Promised him an answer on Saturday in
Easter week. He told another man that Heidon promised his master it
should be put in award by Palm Sunday; ‘for he is double both to him and
to me, and so is William Geney and mo of my counsel.’ He is willing to
make a release. His barn which his men entered to distrain, he says, is

[From Fenn, i. 162.] This letter, which Fenn vaguely assigned to the
latter part of the reign of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>,
may be pretty safely attributed to the year 1450. The mention of Lord
Rivers and the Duke of Suffolk could not have been earlier than 1449, as
the one was only created lord, and the other duke in 1448, and at a
later date than the 13th of May. The reference to the Duke of Suffolk
again is not likely to have been long after his decease. Further, there
is a strong presumption, from Monday being spoken of as a past date, and
Friday as a future, that the letter was written on a Wednesday. Had it
been on a Tuesday or Thursday, Monday would have been spoken of as
‘yesterday’ or Friday as ‘to-morrow.’ Now, the 13th of May was a
Wednesday in 1450. The changes in officers of state mentioned in this
letter are, therefore, those consequent on the fall of the Duke of
Suffolk. There is, besides, as will be seen by a foot-note, an allusion
to the Parliament at Leicester.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 360.] This letter cannot well be of the same year as
the last, but is probably not many years earlier, and certainly not many
years later. The reasons against its being of the same year
are&mdash;first, that it seems to be implied in the letter preceding
that the Earl of Oxford was at Winch, near Lynn, in Norfolk, on the 13th
May 1450, which makes it improbable that he would be at Wivenhoe in
Essex four days after; and, secondly, that he is not likely to have
offered to go into Norfolk (especially after having just come out of
Norfolk) on a matter touching the private affairs of one of his own
adherents, when he declined to go to the Parliament at Leicester.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 54.] This letter was actually written in the year 1465;
but as the circumstances to which it relates belong to the year 1450,
and are connected with the memorable insurrection of Jack Cade, we have
thought it right, as Fenn did, to place it under the earlier year.</p>

Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter. During the civil war which followed, he
adhered to the House of Lancaster, though he married Edward&nbsp;<span

seized by Cade’s followers, and pressed into their service.</p>

Robert Poynings, who, some years before this letter was written, had
married Elizabeth, the sister of John Paston, was sword-bearer and
carver to Cade, and was accused of creating disturbances on more than
one occasion afterwards. He was slain at the second battle of St. Albans
on the 17th Feb. 1461.</p>

<p>Inquiry made as to the injury of Sporle wood for lack of hedging. The
three years’ growth of the wood availeth no man. The farmers now cannot
sell it the better, so it must be either to your hurt or Halman’s. Hopes
the wastes at Cressingham will be amended. Your tenants are treated
unfairly about the Sheriff’s turn by those of the Prior of Norwich and
John Coo. Can get no money, for Fulchier hopes he is not so far in
arrear as you think. Halman can get no money; his corns are so cheap he
will not sell, but he hopes to make purveyance at Michaelmas.</p>

<p>Calybut says he never asked the Vicar of Sporle to be bound for him.
They will meet with me at Gressenhale on St. Bartholomew’s day and seal
the other part, so that they have notice from you at Swaffham Market,

[Douce <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 393, f. 88.] From the
similarity of the contents of this and the two following letters, it is
evident that they belong to the same year; and the mention of Thomas
Denyes, from whom the Earl of Oxford was afterwards estranged, proves
that it must have been before 1454. In the summer of 1450, there was
disaffection in Norfolk, which led to the issuing of a special
commission of <i>oyer and terminer</i> in September. These three letters
may, therefore, have belonged to that year.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The two
letters following are from contemporaneous copies written on the same
paper. Being dated the same day as the preceding letter of the Earl of
Oxford, and addressed to the two persons named in the postscript, we
should have every reason to suppose they are the copies there mentioned,
were it not for the circumstance that the Earl of Oxford’s seat at
Wynche, near Lynn, in Norfolk, must have been a good day’s journey from
Bury St. Edmunds. The internal evidence, however, is in other respects
so strong that we have no doubt at all upon the subject. The difficulty
as to the date may be accounted for by supposing that these two letters
were really written at Wynche the day before, but that the date 21st
August was filled in by the Earl at Bury St. Edmunds at the time he
despatched his letter of the same date to John Paston.</p>

Owt of dowte the cuntre is not so disposed, for it is desired ageyn
suche persones as the c[untre] wolde were ponysshid; and if they be not
ponysshid to refourme that they have do amysse, by liklynesse the cuntre
wole rise up on th[em]. Men talke that a general oier and termyner is
graunted to the Duke of Norfolk, my Lord of Ely, the Erll of Oxenford,
the Lord Scales, Sir John Fastolf, Sir Thomas Fulthorp, and William
Yelverton, and men be right glad therof. Yet that notwithstondyng,

matier was in trete by th’assent of the Lord Moleyns a twene his

the more part there was a sergeant and vj. or vij. thrifty apprentisez;
at whiche tyme the Lord Moleyns title was shewed, and clerly answerid,
in so meche that his own counseil seide they cowde no forther in the
matier, desiryng me to ride to Salesbury to the Lord Moleyns, promyttyng
of their part that thei wolde moeve the Lord Moleyns, so that thei
trusted I shuld have myn entent or I come thens; of whiche title and
answer I send yow a copie that hath be put in to the Parlement, the Lord
Moleyns being there present, whereto he cowde not sey nay. Also by fore
this tyme I have agreed to put it in ij. juges, so thei wolde determyne
by our evydences the right, moevyng nother partie to yeve other by ony
mene, but only the right determyned, he to be fully recompensed that
hath right. Whereto he wold not agree, but alle tymes wolde that thoe
juges shulde entrete the parties as they myght be drawe to by offre and
profre to my conceyte as men bye hors. Whiche matiers considerid, my
counseil hath alwey conceyved that the tretees he offred hath be to non
othir entent but to delaye the matier, or ellis to entrete me to relese
my damages, for title hath he non. And he knowith weel the title shall
never better be undirstond thanne it hath be by his counseil and myn
atte seid comunycacions. And also my Lord Chaunceler undirstond that the
Lord Moleyns men toke and bar away more than cc<i>li.</i> [£200] worth

parcell, wherto al the world knoweth he canne make no title. And if he
were disposed to do right, my counseil thynketh he shuld restore that,
for therfor nedith nowthir comunycacion nor trete. And with owt he wole
restore that, I&nbsp;trowe no man can thynk that his trete is to no good
purpose.</p>

wondered what title you would claim to the land. I&nbsp;said, men said
it was once free till it was soiled by a bondman. He gave more weight to
the evidence of John Aleyn and Nicholas Waterman. Aleyn says he was
steward of the manor, in Garleke’s days, forty years, and never knew it
claimed for bond ground; and the said Nicholas says it was he who moved
your father to buy the manor. Many others have set their seals to
corroborate this. Asked him to be good unto Henry Halman, who was

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is anonymous, but is in the handwriting of James Gresham. It must have
been written in the autumn of the year 1450, while Lord Molyns was in
Wiltshire, and when the nomination of John Jermyn as Sheriff of Norfolk
was expected, but had not yet been decided on, or at least not known to
the writer. It was therefore certainly written after the preceding
number, though the latter is probably not the letter to which it was
intended to serve as a postscript.</p>

and that which follows clearly refer to the same matter. The time of
year and the part taken by the Duke of York in the election are
circumstances which in themselves create a pretty strong presumption in
favour of the year 1450. And this presumption almost becomes a
certainty, when we observe that the date of this letter&mdash;16th
October&mdash;was a Friday in that year; for the meeting of York and
Norfolk is stated in the next letter to have been on a Thursday and
Friday, and this letter would doubtless have been written as soon as a

the last two letters, he was going in November. The nomination of

Thanks the Parson for a letter by Robert Botiller, and one by John
Clerc, advising that Bokking and William Jenney be ‘in that parties’

the first purchase of Haylysdon. Is glad John Clerc is come. Much
strange labour has been made to him by Tasborough and Swolle. Complains
of the untruth of Appulzerd of Norwich in the Lady Bardolf’s matter.

wrong against Fastolf. William Barker had a box of evidences of the farm
of Lady Bardolf’s lands, and a deed of Norman’s feoffment with evidences
of Saxthorp, which cannot be found here, and must have been left at
Norwich or Castre. Don’t forget Norman’s matter, and the maintainers of
the false inquest of Beyton Bradwell. Wyndham wants to be friends with
me about the Lady Bardolf’s matter. The master of St. Giles has been
with me for the purchase of Mundham Maner with appurtenances in
Cyselond, and I have agreed with him for 200 marks. Don’t forget the
bailly of Hykelyng, who said I should forge [<i>i.e.</i> had forged]
evidence, &amp;c.</p>

wull not discharge your baly of xvvj<i>s.</i> and viij<i>d.</i>, which
he toke the seid baly enseled in a purs. The seid Wharles told my

you any peny till he had be distreyned; and he seid than pleynly that he
wull nomore pay till he were distreyned. I&nbsp;have be there divers
tymes for to distreyn hym, and I cowde never do it but if
[<i>unless</i>] I wuld a distreyned hym in his moders hous, and there I
durst not for her cursyng. The baly of the hundred told me that Wharles
spake to hym in cas he had be distreyned that he wold have gete hym a
replevy; and the baly bad hym kete a replevy of his mayster and he wold
serve&nbsp;it.</p>

Gonnor had gret rewle in the seid town, I&nbsp;toke with me the baly of
the hundred and set hym with me in my Lord of Norffolks warant, and than
yede in to the court ther as Gonnor and Bettes wern. The seid baly told
Gonnor of this warant, and Gonnor rebuked hym so that he durst not a
rest the seid Bettes. Than I toke it up on me and arested hym myself as
he sate be Gonnor. Gonnor desired than to se my warant, and I shewed it
hym, and he seid he wold obey it as the lawe wold. And he proferyd me
suerte, men of the seid town of Routon. Than I told hym, and
[<i>i.e.</i> if] he wold be bownd hym self with othre I would agre ther
to, but I wuld have no shipmen that had nought, ner such men that rought
[<i>cared</i>] never, and thei were onys on the see, wheder thei come
ageyn or noght. Than Bettes toke Gonnor a <i>supersedias</i> that he had
of Wychyngham twelmoneth ago for anothre man that asked suerte of the
seid Bettes. I&nbsp;wold have had it, and he wold not lete me have it,
ner shewe it me but in his hands. Than I told hym that it was noght, and
he seid it was gode i nowe. I&nbsp;bad hym take it me for my discharge,
and he seid pleynly I shuld not have it. Than I told hym I wold have my
prisoner. The seid Gonnor seid I shuld not have hym, and dede set alle
the tenaunts up on me and made a gret noyse, and seydyn alle pleynly I
shuld not have hym yf he wold abyde with hem. Than I told Gonnor that I
shuld certifie a rescuse, and prayd the baly of the hundred that he wold
record the same. Item, the seid Gonnor seid I myght have favoryd the
seid Bettes the more be cause the seid Bettes was my mayster Stapylton
man, and that his men shuld not be bownd and I
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page221" id = "page221">221</a></span>
shuld go lose. He seid I shuld be tyed or aght longe and alle my
feleshep bothyn; but, God yeld hym, he hath yovyn me iiij. days respyte.
Than I told hym it shuld never ly in his power to bynde me, ner non of
my feleshep so fast but that it shuld be in your power to make hym to
losyn us, and if that he abode in Norffolk he shuld be made to seke the
skyrts of his sadill or Esterne. And if he had kept his wey that nyght I
shuld have kept hym trewe covenaunte, for I lay on wayte up on hym on
the heth as he shuld have comen humward, and if I myght have met with
hym I shuld have had Bettes from hym; but he had leyd such wetche that
he had aspied us or he cam fully at us; and he remembered Wyndhams
manhood, that iiij. swyft fete were better than ij. hands, and he toke
his hors with the spores and rode to Felbrygge Hall as fast as he myght
rydyn, and I suppose he lay ther all that nyght.</p>

<p>Item, the seid Gonnor manased and thret John of Beston for he wuld
not warn hym her of; and he dede sease alle his lond in Routon, and
warned hym that he shuld not occupy his lyme kyll ner no lond that he
had in Routon; and he mad his avaunte whan I was gon, if that I had not
brought the baly of the hundred with me I shuld never have go thens; and
yet, not withstandyng that I brought the baly with me, and thei had wust
where myn hors had stond I shuld have be wele betyn. All this language
had thei whan that I was gon.</p>

<p>Item, the seid Gonnor seid after that I was gon to the tenaunts of
the seid town, that his <i>supersedias</i> was noght, and as for the
rescuse, he shuld purvey a mene to excuse it. Where fore and it pleasyd
you to send my mastres word how that I shuld be demened with the seid
Bettes, and wheder that ye wuld I shuld a rest hym ageyn or nought, and
to purvey such a mene for Gonnor that he myght ley his bost, it shuld be
gret comfort to all yowr frendes and tenauntes ther abowtyn.</p>

<p>Item, I have be at my mayster Stapilton with your writtes, and he
made it right straunge for to ensele hem. He seid that he knew of nown
such inquiscion takyn at Swafham beforn hym; he seid if it were
presented ther, it was presented in his absens, whill that he was in his
inne; wherfore he seid
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page222" id = "page222">222</a></span>
he wold not ensele hem till he sey the bokes. Whan I had answeryd hym
ther to, than he seid he wold comown with my mayster Yelverton her of
whan he come home, and til he had spok with hym he wold not ensele hem.
I&nbsp;told hym my mayster Yelverton had enseled hem. Thann he seid he
knew not my mayster Yelverton seale. He shewed it to Gonnor, and asked
hym wheder it was his seall or noght. Gonnor seid it was his sealle.
Than my mayster Stapilton brake ought of this mater and spake to me of
the a restyng of Bettes and makyng of affray up on Gonnor. He seid
Gonnor cam to hym to compleyn up on me. I&nbsp;told hym that Gonnor had
enformed hym as it plesyd hym, for I had yove hym no cause to compleyn
of me, and if it pleased hym to her myn excuse he shuld fynd me in no
defaute. Whan he had herd myn excuse, he cowde not blame me. Meche othre
langage we had, for I was with hym ner an ower. Than he asked me wheder
the inquisicion was taken be fore the justice of the peas or the justice
of the <i>oyer determyner</i>. I told hym be for the justic of the peas,
for I seid it was the cessyons of the peas at Swafham. Than he bad me
put up my warants, for he seid he wold not ensele hem till he had
comowned with my maister Yelverton. I&nbsp;told hym it shuld not nede to
comown with my mayster Yelverton, ner labor hym therfore, for I seid it
myght not hurt thow he enseled hem not; for I seid the writts were
executed, and that the shereff had mad ought warants of them, and his
warants were executed, and so the seid writts shuld stand you in litill
avayll, save only, I&nbsp;told hym, ye desiryd his sealle, because it
was fownd before othre lords with hym, and that he stode in the
<i>teste</i> of the said writts, and that was cause of my comyng theder.
Than he wend I had comyn for to assayn hym, for forthwith he enseled
hem, but me thynk be his langage he hath be labored of the toder
part.</p>

<p>Item, and it pleased your gode maystershep to gete of my mayster
Yelverton a <i>supersedias</i> for John Osborn and an othre for me. We
suppose that Gonnor and Bettes wull do us arest, and we wuld the

[From Fenn, iii. 238.] The date of this letter is quite uncertain. Fenn
assigns it to the year 1454, when Lent began very late, as it is evident
the herrings and eels referred to were intended as provision for that
season. This conjecture may be correct; but it must be noted that John
Paston was at home at Norwich, if not in the beginning of Lent, at least
on the fourth Sunday of Lent in 1454. Moreover, if the date of this
letter, ‘Monday next after St. Edward,’ means after the 18th March,
which was the day of St. Edward the King and Martyr, the year 1451 would
suit rather better than 1454; for, in the former year, the Monday after
St. Edward’s day would be the 22nd of March, and Ash Wednesday the 10th,
while in the latter the Monday after St. Edward would be the 25th, and
Ash Wednesday the 6th, so that the provision of herrings would be very
late.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This is a
rough draft of a Petition which seems to have been intended for
presentation to Parliament in the beginning of the year 1451. Parliament
was prorogued on the 18th December 1450 till the 20th January following,
but it did not actually meet again for despatch of business till the
29th April. It would appear from this Petition that Sir Thomas Tuddenham
and his adherents were indicted before the Earl of Oxford at the
sessions of <i>oyer and terminer</i> which sat on the 2nd March
1451.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 84.] The date of this letter depends upon the age of
John Paston, who, in November 1444, was found to be twenty-three years
old. As he is now ‘upon the age of thirty winters,’ this letter was
probably written in 1451.</p>

In 1444, according to Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norf.</i> iv.&nbsp;40),
a&nbsp;rent-charge out of the manor of Swainsthorp was settled by John
and Agnes Paston, the eldest son and the widow of William Paston, the
Justice, to find a priest to sing for the soul of the said William in
the chapel of our Lady the Great in Norwich Cathedral.</p>

of Swafham, youres, my Maister Inglose,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag238_3" id = "tag238_3" href = "#note238_3">238.3</a> Pastons, and
many other playntyfs had put in and declared, bothe by writyng and by
woord by fore the Jugez, the lawfull excepcions in many wise, the Juges
by ther wilfulnesse myght nat fynde in ther hert to gef, not als moche
as a bek nor a twynclyng of ther eye toward, but toke it to deriscion,
God reforme such parcialte; and by cause Prisot<a class = "tag" name =
"tag238_4" id = "tag238_4" href = "#note238_4">238.4</a> thought that yf
the Sessions of the oyer determyner had be holden at Norwich as they
bygonne, he supposed it shuld nat so fast passe to th’entent of Tudenham
and Heydon and ther felawes, as it shuld do ell[es] in other place, but
enjorned to Walsyngham, wher they have grettist rule, ther to be holden
on Tuesday, iiij<sup>te</sup> day of May.</p>

<p>This knowing, my Maister Yelverton,<a class = "tag" name = "tag238_5"

thedre wer cleped alle the frendez, knyghteys, and esquiers, and
gentilmen that wolde in nowise do other wise than they wolde. And the
seid Tudenham, Heydon, and other oppressours of ther set come doun
theder, as I understand, with iiij<sup>c.</sup> [400] hors and more; and
consideryng how ther wellwillers wer ther assembled at ther instaunce,
it had be right jowpertous and ferefull for any of the pleyntyfs to have
be present, for ther was nat one of the pleyntyfs ner compleynuantez
ther, but your right feithfull and trusty weel willer John Paston. And
my Maister Yelverton seid full discretly, and countrolled the seid
Prisot when he seid, sittyng, in the Guyhalle of Norwich, these wordys
to the Meyre and Commonalte, ‘A, Sir Meyre and your brethren, as to the
processe of youre compleyntez, we wole put them in contynuance, but in
all other we wole procede;’ which wordys Yelverton thought right
parciall. And by side this the seid Prisot wolde suffre no man that was
lerned to speke for the pleyntyfs, but took it as a venom, and took them
by the nose at every thred woord whiche myght weel by knowe for open
parcialte.</p>

<p>And as for the Lord Scalys, ye knowe well what he is toward you, and
namely for Hikelyng matter. Also to knowe som of your feynt frendes, at
that tyme that my Lord Norffolk sat at Norwich up on the oyer

furlong from his duellyng place to the shirehouse, but now he cowd ryde
from Norwich to Walsyngham to syt as one of the Commyssioners. As to the
rule of other, that ye wolde have supposed your wellewillers, how they
have byhavyd them at Walsyngham, I&nbsp;shall sende yow woord in all

Walsyngham. But this I knowe well, that they founde none obstacle ner
impedyment in ther consciens in all your matter; but how they have do
with Norwich, Swafham, and Paston, I&nbsp;am nat yet clerly informed;
I&nbsp;suppose they arn put in respite. I&nbsp;here sey Heydon seweth

<p>Item, as for the ij. <i>venire facias</i> ye sent to be retorned for

myght procede, so that bothe maters myght take up on a day, for they sey
it wold drawe xx. marc to labour the Jure to London, and yet it wer hard

as for that that was left wyth hese Under shereff, it is your wyl he
shuld send a man of hese for it; for thow it were more ye wold gladly he
shuld take it; he thanked yow, and sayde hese Under shereff was at
London, and hymselff had non deserved, and if he had he wold a take it.
And whan I departyd from hym, I&nbsp;desyerid hym a yen to send
therffore, and than he seyde it shuld abyde tyl ye come hom, wherby I
conceyve he wold have it, and be gladde to take it. Moreover,
I&nbsp;remembred hym of hese promyses made before to yow at London, when
he took hese oth and charche, and that ye were wyth hym when he toke
hese oth, and oder dyvers tymes; and for tho promyses made be hym to yow
at that tyme, and other tymes at the oyer determyner at Lynne, ye
proposed yow be the trust that ye have in hym for to atempte and rere
accions that shuld be to the avayle of hym and of hese office. He wold a
know what the accions shuld be. I&nbsp;sayde I coude not telle hym, and
than he seyde he wold do for yow that he may, excepte for the aquitell
of the Lord Molyns men, in so meche as the Kyng hath wrete to hym for to
shewe favour to the Lord Moleyns and hese men, and as he seyth the
indytement longyth to the Kyng, and not to yow,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page242" id = "page242">242</a></span>
and the Lord Molyns a gret lord. Also, as he seyth, now late the Lord
Molyns hath sent hym a letter, and my Lord of Norffolk anoder, for to
shew favour in these indytements, he darnot abide the joporte of that,
that he shuld offende the Kinges commaundment. He know not how the Kyng
may be informed of hym, and what shal be seyde to hym.</p>

<p>And than I sayde as for any joporte that he shuld abyde in any thing
that he doth for yow, or be your desyre, you have offered hym, and wol
performet, sufficient sewerte for to sawe hym harmeles, and therfore I
supposid ther wold non resonable man thynk but that he myght do for yow
wyth owte any joporte. And then he seyde he myth non sewerte take that
passid C<i>li.</i>; and the Lord Molyns is a gret lord, he myght soon
cause hym to lese that, and meche mo. Than I sayde, be that meane, in
defawte of a Shereff, every man may be put from hese lyvelod; and thann
he seyde iff it were for the lyvelode, men wold take hem the nerer for
to abyde a joporte; but be hese feyth, as he swore, if the Kyng wryte
ayan to hym he wol no lenger abyde the joporte of the Kyngges wrytyng,
but he trustyth to Godde to inpanell seche men as shuln to hise
knowleche be indeferent, and non comon jurors. As me semyth it wold do
goode and [<i>if</i>] ye wolde gett a comaundment of the Kyng to the
Shereff for to shew yow favour, and to inpanell jantelmen, and not for
to favour non seche riotts, &amp;c.; for he seyde that he sent yow the
letter that the Kyng sent hym, and ye seyde a man shuld gete seche on
for a noble.</p>

<p>Item, I remembred hym of the promyses that he hath made to Temperley,
and that if he wold make yow very trew promys, ye wold rewarde hym as
meche as he wold desire, or any other resonable man for him, and asmoche
and mor then any adverserry ye have wold gef hym; than he seyde he toke
never no mony of non of hem alle. There was proferid hym at Walsyngham
for the Lord Molyns xx. nobles, he had not a peny; moreover,
I&nbsp;proferid hym, if he wold make yow promys that ye myght veryly
trust upon hym, ye wold geff hym in hande as he wold desire, or to leve
a summe if he wold a named it in a mene mannys hand, and seche as he
hath trust
<span class = "pagenum">

to. And then he seyde, if he myght do for yow, or if he do any thyng for
yow, then he wol take yowre mony wyth a good wyl; and other promys I
coude not have of hym, but that he wol do for yow all that he may,
excepte for the inditements. I&nbsp;conceyve veryly he hath made promys
to do hese part that they shul be a quytte, but I suppose he hath made
non other promys ayens yow for the lyvelode; but he lokyth aftyr a gret
brybe, but it is not for to trust hym veryly wyth owte that he may not
chese. I&nbsp;suppose he had no wrytyng fro my Lord of Norffolk as he
seyde.</p>

<p>I was at Framyngham for to a spoke wyth Tymperley, Debnam, or Berry,
and they were all ought. My Lord, as he came from London, he was at
Yepysweche on Moneday, and when he wythowth the town toward Framyngham,
he had all hese men ryde forth afore a gret pase, for he wolde felwe
softely; and when hese men were owte of syght, he rode wyth v. men to a
squieris place of hese therby, and on Tewsday, rodde my Lady to hym; and
so I dede nought at Framyngham. No more at thys tyme, but All myghty

[From Fenn, iii. 308.] At the date of this letter Lord Molyns had
probably been acquitted, but the action against his men was still
pending. The year must therefore be 1451. The date ‘Thursday next after
St. Austin’ is understood by Fenn to be after the Feast of St. Austin,
or Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, which was celebrated on the 28th of
August; but the dates of the preceding letters make it more probable
that the writer means St. Augustine, the apostle of England, whose day
was the 26th of May.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 44.] This letter of Agnes Paston’s refers to the same
subject of dispute as the two preceding, and was probably written after
them; but the exact year is not certain.</p>

‘To owl,’ says Fenn, ‘may signify to deceive, as an owler is a person
who carries contraband goods in the night; though I rather think it
means in this place to oil, that is, to smooth to her purpose; but q.?’
The explanation certainly is not very satisfactory. From the definition
of ‘owler’ we might perhaps conjecture with more probability that ‘to
owl’ was to work in the night time. Did Agnes Paston, to avoid
interruption, set men to build the wall by night?</p>

entry of Daniel into Brayston in 1450, and, from the terms of the

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This is
printed from a rough draft in John Paston’s handwriting, on the back of
which is a draft of the preceding letter. The date of both letters is
the same. The reading of particular words in this draft is very
uncertain, owing to the cramped handwriting used in corrections and
interlineations, and the manner in which several of the words are
abbreviated.</p>

The preceding words from ‘and desirid’ are a peculiarly illegible
interlineation, and do not appear to form a consecutive sense along with
the passage following. Perhaps the words ‘and daily hath’ should have
been erased, which would make the connection intelligible.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 162.] This letter is certainly not earlier than 1451 or
later than 1453; for it was written some time after Lady Boys became a
widow, which was in December 1450 (<i>see</i> p. 198), and before Sir
John Fastolf’s removal from London into Norfolk, which, as will be seen
hereafter, was in the autumn of 1454. Probably the true date is 1452,
for in the summer following, owing to Gurney’s utter inability to pay
his rent, we find Agnes Paston urging her son seriously to look out for
another tenant for Orwellbury.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 68.] According to Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norf.</i> iii.
158), Margaret of Anjou, Queen of Henry&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, visited Norwich in the spring of 1452; but by
the same authority, it would appear that she had returned to Westminster
before the 17th of March in that year, which would not suit the date of
this letter. Besides, John Paston was at Norwich in April 1452, and
dates a letter at Norwich on St. George’s day, complaining of the
assault made upon him at the door of Norwich Cathedral on Monday before
Easter. It is impossible, therefore, that Margaret Paston could have
written to him from Norwich two days before St. George’s day in that
year. From an undated entry in the Norwich city records, which bears
internal evidence of having been made in the year 1453, it would appear
that the King’s half-brothers, Edmund, Earl of Richmond, and Jasper,
Earl of Pembroke, visited Norwich in that year.&mdash;(<i>See</i> fol.
19 of a volume, entitled <i>An Old Free Book</i>, in the Norwich city
archives.) As to the Queen’s visit I find no direct evidence, but I
think it possible she may have come with <i>one</i> of the King’s
brothers, and that the other may have come a little later.</p>

neither signature nor address to this letter, but it is undoubtedly from
Margaret Paston to her husband. The handwriting is the same as that of
her other letters. The date seems to be after the death of Sir John
Heveningham in 1453, and is not likely to have been a later year, as the
Duchess of Suffolk’s influence must have been diminished when the Duke
of York came into power, though it may possibly have been powerful again

[From Fenn, iii. 108.] This paper is headed ‘Copia’ in the <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> It is entitled by Fenn, ‘The Speech of John
Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, against Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, in
the House of Lords.’ This title, however, is clearly no part of the
original document, which has much more the character of a petition to
the Privy Council than of a speech in Parliament. The paper itself
professes to be a ‘bill’ signed by its author, who demands that the
conduct of the Duke of Somerset in France and in England should be made
the subject of investigation by separate tribunals according to the laws
of either country. Now the House of Lords, being only a branch of the
English Legislature, would have had no right to authorise a judicial
investigation in France. The date of this petition must have been in the
end of the year 1453, after the loss of Guienne. The Duke of Somerset
appears to have been committed to the Tower a little before Christmas in
that year; for, after his liberation on the 4th March 1455, he declared
before the Council that he had been confined there ‘one whole year, ten
weeks, and more.’&mdash;<i>See</i> Rymer, xi. 362.</p>

to have aboute hym; and their harneys to come in cartes, as my Lord of

[From Fenn, iii. 170.] The request made at the end of this letter that
John Paston would procure his wife an ornament for her neck, is noted by
Fenn as one that she had made in April 1452, and of which this was
probably a repetition nine months afterwards. There seems no better
evidence of date to go by, so we follow the same mode of inference; but
as we have placed the letter containing the first petition for the
necklace in 1453 instead of 1452, we must attribute this letter to the
year 1454.</p>

writer was unknown to Fenn; but a comparison with the letter which
follows (now printed for the first time) leaves no doubt that it was
written by Thomas Denyes, whom we have already met with as a dependant
of the Earl of Oxford (<i>see</i> Letters 123, 124, and 132). The date

ther of she hath sent now to Ovy also. And as for more evidence, sum is

<p>Othre evidence of myn is at Folsham, I wote not with whome.

Maile, for I conceyve hym right feithfull to me, and I am enfourmed that
he is gretly manasid for me. And that ye vouchsauf to do put hym in
comfort that I lese not his good wille, and that ye shew hym your good
maistership and favor that he be holpen and not hurt for me.
Ferthermore, I&nbsp;wrote to you for such smal thynges as I had leid to

sith they make a privy labor to haf me remevid, and I wote not whedir,
ne wethir that tyme I shal be sent to the Kynges Bench, and abide ther,

<p>Neverthelesse, if I haf releve of such pouer godes as shuld be myn by
reson, than I hope to do better, and sumwhat to aquyte, wherby I hope to
put my frends in gretter corage to do for me. And if I haf no releve,
than can I nomore, but all refere to God as I do daily. Wherefore, if ye
be not paied, I&nbsp;pray you to councell my said frendes to send me
suche mony as thei may gete of myn agayn that day, ever your maistership

thyng as I haf is, to that intent that thei may riffel and dispoil all.
Wherof, if such case hapne, I&nbsp;can no ferthre, but I besech your
help in every thyng. It is yours all, ther is a dede of gifft therof to

[From Fenn, iii. 210.] This letter gives an account of certain
proceedings for taking possession of the person of a minor in opposition
to the claims of Paston and Sir John Fastolf as guardians. Fenn supposes
the ward in question to have been Thomas Fastolf of Ipswich; but it
appears, by a petition afterwards presented to Parliament (see <i>Rolls
of Parl.</i> v. 371), that he was another Thomas Fastolf, viz. the son
of John Fastolf, Esq. of Cowhawe, Suffolk, whose wardship was granted on
the 6th June 1454 to John Paston, Esq., and Thomas Howes, clerk. The St.
John’s day mentioned in this letter is therefore St. John the Baptist’s
day, 24th June, not St. John the Evangelist’s, 27th December.</p>

James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond. He was appointed Lord
Treasurer of England on the 15th March 1455 (Patent, 33 Henry&nbsp;<span
class = "smallroman">VI.</span>, p. 2, m.&nbsp;20), but on the 29th May
following the office was taken from him, and given to Henry, Viscount
Bourchier (<i>Ib.</i> m.&nbsp;12). But this letter, which is dated in
July, cannot be in 1455; indeed, we have positive evidence that it is in
1454. How, then, are we to explain the manner in which Wiltshire is
referred to above? It is just possible&mdash;though not likely, as
Wiltshire was a Lancastrian&mdash;that his appointment may have been
enrolled in the wrong year, and that he was really made Lord Treasurer
on the 15th March 1454. A&nbsp;difference in punctuation will perhaps
solve the difficulty best:&mdash; ‘The Lords that be appointed to keep
the see maken hem ready yn all haste, and the Treasourer also: the Lord
Wyltshyre for the west coast.’ John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, is
mentioned as Lord Treasurer on the 11th February 1454.&mdash;See

The name was printed by Fenn ‘St’myn’,’ and in the modern version on the
opposite page, ‘St. Myn.’ Robert Sturmy was Mayor of Bristol in the year
1453&ndash;4. It was probably this very ship that was captured by the
Genoese in 1457, of which disaster there is the following notice in the
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> Calendars of Bristol:&mdash; ‘Mr.
Robert Sturney [<i>alias</i> Sturmey], who was Mayor in 1453, had this
year a ship spoiled in the Mediterranean Sea by the Genoese, which ship
had gotten much wealth as having been long forth. She had spices fit to
be planted here in England, as was reported, but the men of Genoa in
envy spoiled her. Which wrong, when King Henry understood, he arrested
the Genoa merchants in London, seized their goods, and imprisoned their
persons, until they gave security to make good the loss; so that they
were charged with £6000 indebted to Mr. Sturney.’&mdash;Seyer’s
<i>Memoirs of Bristol</i>, ii. 189.</p>

‘The said town,’ it would appear, did ‘do her part’ on the occasion; for
besides this ship fitted out by the Mayor, Bristol subscribed £150 to a
loan raised by the Duke of York from the seaports for the protection of
trade. This sum may appear insignificant for a flourishing seaport; but
London itself only subscribed £300, and Southampton, which was the next
largest contributor, only £100, while Norwich and Yarmouth contributed
the latter amount between them.&mdash;Seyer’s <i>Bristol</i>, ii. 188;
see also <i>Rolls of Parl.</i> v. 245. We must remember, however, that
these sums probably represent about fifteen times their value in modern
currency. At all events, by comparison with other places, Botoner had no
cause to be ashamed of his native town.</p>

is in the handwriting of William Paston, son of the judge; but the
‘Margery’ Paston to whom it is addressed seems to be his brother John’s
wife, Margaret. His nephews, John Paston’s sons, were at school in
London. His sister Elizabeth, who was married to Robert Poynings in
1458, is here said to be upon the point of marriage, but no doubt this
refers to the negotiations of the year 1454, as the eldest of John
Paston’s sons must have been sixteen in 1458. St. Laurence’s day, on

been purchased by the Earl of Warwick or having belonged to the Prior of
Walsingham, as stated in the next letter, Blomefield tells us nothing
except that Richard, Earl of Warwick, presented to the rectory of
Snoring Parva in 1460 and 1466.</p>

[From Fenn, iii. 318.] This and the next letter were certainly written
on the same day, but the precise year may be questioned. From a
comparison of the two together, with William Barker’s letter of the 3rd
Nov. following (No.&nbsp;265), I&nbsp;am inclined to think all three
belong to the year 1454, when Sir John Fastolf had just come to settle
for the rest of his days in Norfolk. Sir John Fenn, I&nbsp;think
rightly, considers this first letter to have been written between jest
and earnest; and this tone may be very well explained by the
supposition, that on Fastolf’s settlement at Caister, Worcester expected
to have had some position of importance assigned to him in his master’s
household. That such would be his fortune was probably the expectation
of others as well as himself, and apparently John Paston had written to
him in the belief that Worcester’s influence with Sir John might
occasionally be of value to him.</p>
